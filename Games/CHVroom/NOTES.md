# Vroom development notes

## Scope

The confirmed reference is sections 11 and 12 of [plan.md](plan.md). This is a
CHGame Rev0 sketch kept beside the upstream checkout, not added to its
casino collection. No upstream library or platform files are modified.

## Structure

- `vroom.ino`: setup, fixed 60 Hz logic with bounded catch-up, DMA-safe drawing.
- `Game.h/.cpp`: integer vehicle physics, opponents, upgrades, payouts.
- `App.h/.cpp`: menus, input, sound, debug hook, saves.
- `Sounds.h/.cpp`: sound step tables and effect priorities.
- `View.h/.cpp`: pixel cars, parallax city, dashboard, reusable UI drawing.
- `tools/tests/test_vroom.cpp`: host physics, economy, and progression tests.
- `tools/scripts/`: deterministic UI, NOS, saves, and championship checks.

The save handshake and magic are `VRM1`; configuration prefix is `VRM_`.
Save schema version 1 holds cash, wins, unlocks, levels, champion status,
and ten personal best times, within the library's 244-byte payload.
Records are validated at boot; invalid or incompatible records start fresh.
Flash writes occur only between `gfx_wait()` and the next flush.
Save failure is shown on menu screens; the next result or purchase retries.
CHGame's save pages are shared between games, so another game's saves can
replace Vroom's progress, as on the rest of the platform.

## Commands

Run from the workspace root:

```bash
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py build
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py test
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py check --no-device
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py gif
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py boxart
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py audio out/audio
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py export --no-build
python3 vroom/tools/vroom.py cart verify vroom/build/vroom.chgame
```

`build` produces `vroom/build/release/vroom.ino.bin`, ELF, HEX, and CHG.
`export` produces `vroom/build/vroom.chgame` for sharing or SD-menu deployment.
The wrapper locates the workspace's bundled arduino-cli if it is not on PATH.
Simulator builds use the repository's preferred Zig compiler. On this
machine GCC 16's chrono headers conflict with Arduino min/max macros in
the upstream simulator; use Zig rather than modifying shared libraries.

## Physics and balance

Speed is mm/s, distance is mm, and races advance at 60 fixed ticks/second.
Gear ratios connect speed to RPM. A broad power curve peaks at 6000 RPM;
the gold shift window is 7000–7600 RPM around a 7300 target. Torque is
limited by tire grip. The first gear's clutch launch maintains 2500 RPM.
Shifts interrupt power for 400–150 ms depending on gearbox level.
A limiter cuts power at 8000 RPM; road drag continues during shifts.
NOS increases requested drive force 45 percent for 120 ticks and remains
subject to traction limits.

Rivals use the same physics and fixed builds/shift thresholds. They finish
in about 23.1 down to 15.1 seconds. An ideal fully upgraded player runs
about 14.9 seconds. Exact ties count as losses. The race ends when the
player finishes; an unfinished rival is shown as BEHIND rather than
inventing an elapsed time.

The campaign test uses ideal shifts and a greedy affordable-upgrade policy,
farming the latest beaten rival when blocked. With the approved price curve,
it completes in 16 races (six replays), about 7.6 modeled minutes including
three-second countdowns and an assumed eight seconds of menu time per race.
Its longest replay stretch between useful purchases is two. The first perfect
win pays $440 and can buy an engine ($350), gearbox ($400), or tires ($300).
These results describe one efficient purchase policy, not every possible
purchase order. This is a balance model, not human playtest evidence.

## Simulator commands

Commands below exist only in debug/simulator builds:

- `V`: report screen, cash, progression, and current race state.
- `O 1` / `O 0`: automated ideal player shifts and NOS on/off.
- `Z`: reset progress and queue an autosave.
- `E`: prepare an upgraded build and the final rival for system checks.
- `U`: reload the real save record (refuses pending writes or invalid data).

The release build contains no automation or progression cheats.
The simulator's save pages persist within a process; `U` tests reloads
through the library. Persistence across physical power cycles requires
console verification.

## Hardware verification remaining

No upload has been performed. Real panel readability, frame timing, audio,
physical input feel, and save persistence across power cycles need a
console check. The approved economy update prioritizes upgrade cadence
over the original 30–45 minute campaign target.

## Initial MVP verification recorded 2026-10-14 (before economy retuning)

- Host suite: 360 checks, zero failures, including a naturally funded campaign.
  Clang AddressSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer also passed.
- Three simulator scenarios (gameplay, smoke, systems) passed; all screenshots
  and GIF frames matched across two runs, with no DMA tearing reports.
- Release: 20,352-byte image; 11,948 bytes static RAM; both save pages free.
  Debug: 25,076-byte image; 12,148 bytes static RAM; both save pages free.
- Five sound effects rendered successfully through the platform audio harness.
- Menu cover passed the platform picture validation. Gameplay GIF is 95,383
  bytes, below the one-megabyte limit.
- Exported cartridge passed `cart verify`.
- The compiled release booted and entered racing in the existing RISC-V
  emulator. Its ten-second run reported 55.4 LCD frame starts per second and
  generated audio. The captured frame is `out/firmware-race.png`.
  This is emulator evidence, not a physical hardware timing measurement.

## Approved economy update verification

The price curve in plan section 12 is now implemented. Payouts, physics,
unlock gates, and save schema remain unchanged; existing saves are compatible.

- Host suite: 183 checks, zero failures. It explicitly checks that a perfect
  first win buys each starter upgrade independently and that the modeled
  efficient campaign never exceeds two replays between useful purchases.
- Campaign model: 16 races, six replays, 14 purchases, 454 modeled seconds.
- All three simulator scripts passed twice with identical images, including
  a first-win engine purchase leaving $90 and a successful save reload.
- Updated release: 20,336-byte image, 11,948 bytes static RAM, two save pages.
- Gameplay preview regenerated with the immediate first-win purchase.
